Good morning Natasha, We have had some operational issues recently with our laser being out of action for approximately 2 weeks. The laser has been back online this week, unfortunately this has slipped our entire production schedule. The orders you are chasing I have asked to be through production next week, painted items will take a little longer. As soon as they are complete we will ship them over to Trend. Will update further next week.

HMRC is gradually introducing the Customs Declaration Service (CDS), the long-term replacement to the current Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (CHIEF) system. The below steps need to be taken to ensure your goods can be imported or exported without interruption. Register for a Government Gateway account Most business will already have a Government Gateway account to access their personal or business tax account. You should use this account to access the Customs Declaration Service (CDS). If you do not have one, you register for a Government Gateway account here.<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624UY-1/c.aspx> You must have an EORI number Most businesses moving goods in and out of the UK already have one. If you don't have one, you can apply for an EORI number here.<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624UZ-1/c.aspx> Register for the Customs Declaration Service (CDS) Use this link to register for the Customs Declaration Service<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624V0-1/c.aspx> this can take up to 5 working days. You'll need your Government Gateway user ID and password as well as: - Your GB EORI number - Your Unique Tax Reference (UTR) number - you can find this here is you don’t know it<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624V1-1/c.aspx> - Address of your business held on customs records - Your National Insurance number (if you're an individual or sole trader) - The date you started your business Paying VAT and Duty If Davies Turner (or other freight forwarding companies you work with) are paying your VAT & Duty on your behalf and then invoicing this back to you, nothing will change to this method. If you are accounting for VAT using Postponed VAT accounting<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624V2-1/c.aspx>, you will need to access your postponed VAT statement<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624V3-1/c.aspx> via the Customs Declaration Service. The other options for paying your VAT and Duty are listed below. You can view your balance and payments in the Customs Declaration Service Financial Dashboard, as well as grant and amend standing authorities for your payment accounts. If you have your own Duty deferment account The Customs Declaration Service uses a separate HMRC bank account to CHIEF, so you’ll need to set up a new direct debit<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624V4-1/c.aspx> You will also need to re-authorise Davies Turner (or other freight forwarding companies you work with) to use your deferment account. This is done in the Customs Declaration Service Finance Dashboard. You can also choose: * cash account<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624V5-1/c.aspx> – these replace the Flexible Accounting System (FAS), and you’ll be set up with one once you’ve registered for the Customs Declaration Service * immediate payment<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624V6-1/c.aspx> by Bacs, CHAPS, online or by telephone banking – you can pay by debit, corporate credit card or cheque * individual guarantee<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624V7-1/c.aspx> – you can use these to cover customs duties for one-off or high value imports * general guarantee account<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624V8-1/c.aspx> – this allows you to provide multiple guarantees from the same account, and continue importing goods into the UK and pay a disputed amount later once agreed [https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/2/5/1/3/0/2/files/imagecache/2228434/w660_2074348_dtlogotrim.jpg] daviesturner.com<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624UP-1/c.aspx> 0330 030 1870 <https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624UQ-1/c.aspx> [https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/sys/socnet/linkedin-v2.png]<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1C4UO-7HQVM3-1624V9-1/c.aspx> [https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/2/5/1/3/0/2/files/imagecache/2228434/w660_222933_silvertoolkit_33.jpg] [https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/2/5/1/3/0/2/files/imagecache/2228434/w660_222934_silvertoolkit_3311.jpg] [https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/2/5/1/3/0/2/files/imagecache/2228434/w660_222935_silvertoolkit_3312.jpg] The UK's largest independent Freight & Logistics provider.

The laser has been back online this week, unfortunately this has slipped our entire production schedule. The orders you are chasing I have asked to be through production next week, painted items will take a little longer. As soon as they are complete we will ship them over to Trend.

Good morning Natasha, We have had some operational issues recently with our laser being out of action for approximately 2 weeks. The laser has been back online this week, unfortunately this has slipped our entire production schedule. The orders you are chasing I have asked to be through production next week, painted items will take a little longer. As soon as they are complete we will ship them over to Trend. Will update further next week.

I’m keen to see lots of businesses try it, which is why we offer a no-obligation trial. We can have you set up within a matter of days and as the UK’s leading provider, we will quickly get to know you and how you like to work, that's where we're unique.

We have found a jig. 2. The height of the support bars is 45mm not 450mm 3. The support struts which go under the cabin car will be the same as the front bumpers you fabricate for us, the one where the 2 struts become a solid plate with two holes. 4. The smaller uprights I have been informed are usually made with a small cut and then slight bent into shape. As luck would have it we have a car in for some repairs and they have a bull bar which if it would be helpful we could possibly bring down to you, I will just to check this with production as I am not sure when it is due to go back to the customer.

The below steps need to be taken to ensure your goods can be imported or exported without interruption. Register for a Government Gateway account Most business will already have a Government Gateway account to access their personal or business tax account. You should use this account to access the Customs Declaration Service (CDS). If you do not have one, you register for a Government Gateway account here.<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6X9-1/c.aspx> You must have an EORI number Most businesses moving goods in and out of the UK already have one. If you don't have one, you can apply for an EORI number here.<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6XA-1/c.aspx> Register for the Customs Declaration Service (CDS) Use this link to register for the Customs Declaration Service<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6XB-1/c.aspx> this can take up to 5 working days. You'll need your Government Gateway user ID and password as well as: - Your GB EORI number - Your Unique Tax Reference (UTR) number - you can find this here is you don’t know it<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6XC-1/c.aspx> - Address of your business held on customs records - Your National Insurance number (if you're an individual or sole trader) - The date you started your business Paying VAT and Duty If Davies Turner (or other freight forwarding companies you work with) are paying your VAT & Duty on your behalf and then invoicing this back to you, nothing will change to this method. If you are accounting for VAT using Postponed VAT accounting<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6XD-1/c.aspx>, you will need to access your postponed VAT statement<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6XE-1/c.aspx> via the Customs Declaration Service. The other options for paying your VAT and Duty are listed below. You can view your balance and payments in the Customs Declaration Service Financial Dashboard, as well as grant and amend standing authorities for your payment accounts. If you have your own Duty deferment account The Customs Declaration Service uses a separate HMRC bank account to CHIEF, so you’ll need to set up a new direct debit<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6XF-1/c.aspx> You will also need to re-authorise Davies Turner (or other freight forwarding companies you work with) to use your deferment account. This is done in the Customs Declaration Service Finance Dashboard. You can also choose: * cash account<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6XG-1/c.aspx> – these replace the Flexible Accounting System (FAS), and you’ll be set up with one once you’ve registered for the Customs Declaration Service * immediate payment<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6XH-1/c.aspx> by Bacs, CHAPS, online or by telephone banking – you can pay by debit, corporate credit card or cheque * individual guarantee<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6XI-1/c.aspx> – you can use these to cover customs duties for one-off or high value imports * general guarantee account<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6XJ-1/c.aspx> – this allows you to provide multiple guarantees from the same account, and continue importing goods into the UK and pay a disputed amount later once agreed [https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/2/5/1/3/0/2/files/imagecache/2228434/w660_2074348_dtlogotrim.jpg] daviesturner.com<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P6A2-1/c.aspx> 0330 030 1870 <https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P69W-1/c.aspx> [https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/sys/socnet/linkedin-v2.png]<https://email.daviesturner.com/4CR4-1BRGY-7HQVM3-15P7Y9-1/c.aspx> [https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/2/5/1/3/0/2/files/imagecache/2228434/w660_222933_silvertoolkit_33.jpg] [https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/2/5/1/3/0/2/files/imagecache/2228434/w660_222934_silvertoolkit_3311.jpg] [https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/2/5/1/3/0/2/files/imagecache/2228434/w660_222935_silvertoolkit_3312.jpg] The UK's largest independent Freight & Logistics provider.

If you enjoy a whisky now and again, you probably also enjoy a top-up. But when you’re responsible for lubricating your mechanical assets, topping-up is just one more time-consuming, costly, and sometimes potentially dangerous task. So let’s raise a glass to one of Scotland’s leading distilleries, who – with ERIKS’ help – found a way to simplify their lubrication regime. NSK show us life under the hygiene regime Hygiene is the key ingredient in food and beverage manufacturing. Complying with stringent hygiene standards demands frequent thorough washdowns to remove dirt and unwanted grease, often at high pressure with chemical cleaning agents. This can often damage sealing systems – allowing water and cleaning solutions into the bearing cavity, and leading to grease washout, corrosion, and – ultimately – reduced bearing life.

Compressed air is an essential part of the diet of any production facility – and the food manufacturing sector is no exception. In fact, this sector uses compressed air in three different ways, making it more important than ever to ensure the air is produced efficiently and used effectively. Now hose expertise goes deeper than ever with ERIKS specialism A submarine costs over £1 billion to build. So the Royal Navy doesn’t just hand over the keys to the crew and tell them to head out to – and under – the sea. Instead, they train them to the peak of expertise on a submarine simulator. And when that simulator needs to be maintained, they don’t just hand over the keys for that either.

According to a recent survey by Grant Thornton, 21% of American workers left their jobs within the last 12 months, and 40% of them are already looking for a new one. LinkedIn data also revealed that the share of job switchers who had been at their previous employer for less than a year increased by 6.5% from 2020 to 2021. While some take these statistics to mean that job switchers must be experiencing buyer’s remorse, others think they’ve just unlocked the secret to increasing their compensation – according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, hourly wages for those who changed jobs rose 5.6% in April, compared to 4.2% for those who stayed. And, among the workers who took a new job last year, 40% reported a pay increase of at least 10%, which is more than double the other survey respondents. Labor market CEOs are getting much bigger raises than their workers, according to an article in last week’s AP News. Recent Equilar data revealed that in 2021, CEOs in the S&P 500 saw their annual compensation packages jump 17.1% to a median of $14.5 million, while private sector workers only saw a 4.4% increase. It’s important to note that CEO compensation is often tied to stock and options that cannot be exercised unless the company meets its goals, and that typically only around 25% of their pay package is liquid. Nevertheless, the gap between CEO and rank-and-file worker compensation is getting bigger. At 50% of the organizations surveyed this year, it would take a worker at the middle of the company’s pay scale more than 186 years to earn what their CEO made just last year. Not surprisingly, many are unhappy with these statistics, and workers and investors alike are starting to push back. Diversity & Inclusion Spain is about to become the first Western country to offer menstrual leave that would allow women with a doctor’s note for severe period pain to take government-funded paid time off (PTO). While certain forms of menstrual leave have long existed in a few countries, including Japan, Indonesia, and Zambia, none are as robust as Spain’s. The policy proponents believe this is an important step in destigmatizing menstruation, while critics argue the bill could harm women in the workforce by feeding into sexist stereotypes about periods making women inferior workers. Some experts propose simply offering unlimited sick leave that employees can use however they choose to avoid awkward and invasive conversations.

In fact, MIT Sloan Review’s recent survey revealed that compensation actually ranked 16th in the list of terms predicting employee turnover. Instead, more and more findings are pointing to culture as the greater predictor of employee attrition. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Benjamin Zweig, a labor economist who teaches at New York University’s Stern School of Business, expanded on this research, explaining that the companies with the highest ratings from their employees in the past year were those that had some connection to the pandemic itself – medical research organizations and even food-delivery services – leading him and other experts to conclude that workers are more satisfied with their jobs, and more likely to stay, when they feel their work matters. So, how do you make work meaningful for your employees? Promote growth and mobility Workers are increasingly eager to see opportunities for learning, development, and advancement in their workplace. In addition, recent research from Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations shows that those who have moved internally within a company not only tend to be high performers, but are also more likely to stay with the organization over time. In fact, the highest performing internal hires tend to stay the longest. While it is important to note that while some employees are looking for promotions, research suggests that many are not necessarily interested in additional work and responsibilities. Rather, they are simply seeking new challenges and the chance to explore something different. According to the MIT Sloan Review, lateral career opportunities are 12x more predictive of employee retention than promotions. So, to create a meaningful work experience for your employees, give them opportunities for growth, movement, and the development of new skills. Build relationships When employees feel they belong, they are 3.5x more likely to contribute to their full potential and are significantly more likely to feel connected to their work, according to research from the Harvard Business Review. That’s why company-organized social events, like happy hours, team-building excursions, dinners, and other fun activities outside the workplace are a great way to promote a healthy corporate culture, help your team members connect to each other, and increase their sense of belonging at work. Give your employees a voice Employees tend to feel more connected to their work when they have a real voice on the team – the ability to influence decisions and processes. IBM research found that 90% of workers said that they are likely to stay at a company that takes and acts on their feedback. So, whenever possible, give your employees the chance to contribute their ideas, encourage them to take ownership, and involve them in decision-making processes. Convey impact When employees recognize the impact of their day-to-day activities, they are much more likely to find their work meaningful. So, take the time to help your team members understand how their role connects to your company mission and values. It can be useful to share relevant customer testimonials with your team to highlight the ways in which their efforts are affecting others and helping the company achieve its goals. Quotable News The UK government was partying during lockdown. A new report released last week described how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his staff permitted at least 16 boozy government parties at the same time as government-introduced Covid regulations barred any socializing. While Johnson acknowledged his accountability for what’s become known as “partygate”, he insisted that he would not resign. “Above all, I take full responsibility for everything that took place on my watch” Boris Johnson, UK Prime Minister The NBA is taking a stand on gun control. Just before tipoff at last week’s playoff game between the Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics, the Heat’s stadium announcer urged fans to advocate for gun reform laws, following the Texas elementary school shooting. “The Heat urges you to contact your state senators by calling 202-224-3121 to leave a message demanding their support for common sense gun laws” Stadium announcer, Miami Heat Question of the week LAST WEEK’S ANSWER: 94% This week: What’s the #1 city for work-life balance?

Это отличный вариант преобразить сквер, территорию рядом с магазином, отелем, деловым центром, кафе и культурным заведением. Эти места становятся запоминающимся местом досуга людей всех возрастных групп. Сухой фонтан отличается тем, что его разрешено устанавливать на любой территории, где есть горизонтальная плоскость. Водная система подобных объектов монтируется ниже уровня земли, за счет чего в другое время территория может использоваться под любые цели. Организация https://fontan-stroy.net.ua рекомендует купить пешеходные фонтаны обычного или интерактивного типа: с подсветкой, музыкальным сопровождением, возможностью управления. В нашей компании оформить заказ на проектирование сухого фонтана для открытых пространств или общественных помещений из долговечных материалов с профессиональным монтажом. Цена сухого фонтана считается индивидуально в зависимости от объема и сложности работ.
